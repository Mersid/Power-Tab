	<description>Handy inspector tab for checking the status of your power network.
	
Power tab adds in an inspector tab, selectable on any conduit, which will show the output of every power producer, consumer and battery on the power network.

Planned additions include line graphs for historical power values, warnings for when power consumption exceed power production, warnings for when battery storage is too low to sustain a network over night, and various doodads and stats to make power network maintainence easier.
